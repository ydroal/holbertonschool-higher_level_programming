# Python - Hello, World

This is the project with Python.
learn about Python programming.


## General

* __Why Python programming is awesome?__  
  Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is easy to learn and use

* __Who created Python?__
  Python was created by Guido van Rossum.

* __Who is Guido van Rossum?__  
  He is a Dutch computer programmer and software developer, best known as the creator of the Python programming language.
  
* __Where does the name ‘Python’ come from__  
  It come from the British comedy troupe Monty Python that Guido van Rossum was a big fan of.

* __What is the Zen of Python__  
  It is a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs that was written by Tim Peters, a long-time contributor to the Python community

* __How to use the Python interpreter__
  Type "python" for starting the Python interpreter and we will see the Python prompt (>>>) 
  then enter Python code and press enter to execute it.

* __How to print text and variables using print__  
  the print() function is used to output text and variables to the console

* __How to use strings__  
  Python has a 'str' type which can be used to store and manipulate text.

* __What are indexing and slicing in Python?__  
  Indexing refers to the process of accessing a specific element in a sequence by index.
  Slicing is a way to extract a substring or a part of a sequence.

* __What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle?__  
  PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)
