# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This is the project with Python.
learn about Python programming.


## General

* __How to use comments__  
  Single-line comments start with the # symbol  
  Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (either single or double).

* __How is Python’s for different from C‘s?__
  In C, the for loop is used to iterate over a range of numbers,but in Python the for loop is used to iterate over any iterable object, such as a list, tuple, or string.  
  Also Syntax is more more readable and automatically incremented for each iteration of the loop.

* __How to use the break and continues statements__  
  The break statement is used to exit a loop early, before the loop condition is met. When a break statement is encountered, the program immediately exits the current loop and continues execution after the loop.  
  The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration.  
  
* __What does the pass statement do, and when to use it__  
  The pass statement does nothing. pass is used when a statement is syntactically required to be written, but the program does not need to do anything 
  The pass statement is often used as a placeholder in code blocks that have not been implemented yet, or in code blocks that are not supposed to do anything.  

* __How to use range__  
    is used to generate a sequence of numbers. 
    The basic syntax for using the range()  
	range(start, stop, step)  
	start: The number to start the sequence at  
	stop: The number to stop the sequence at  
	step: The increment between each number in the sequence.

* __How to use the Python interpreter__
  Type "python" for starting the Python interpreter and we will see the Python prompt (>>>) 
  then enter Python code and press enter to execute it.

* __How to print text and variables using print__  
  the print() function is used to output text and variables to the console

* __How to use strings__  
  Python has a 'str' type which can be used to store and manipulate text.

* __What are indexing and slicing in Python?__  
  Indexing refers to the process of accessing a specific element in a sequence by index.
  Slicing is a way to extract a substring or a part of a sequence.

* __What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle?__  
  PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)
